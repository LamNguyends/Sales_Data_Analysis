## This is to demonstrate my data analytics skills with Python Pandas to answer the business questions from sales data. The process includes data reading, cleaning, manipulating, and analizing.

#### The dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data

## Infomation of the data set
- Order ID - An Order ID is the number system that Amazon uses exclusively to keep track of orders. Each order receives its own Order ID that will not be duplicated. This number can be useful to the seller when attempting to find out certain details about an order such as shipment date or status.
- Product - The product that have been sold.
- Quantity Ordered - Ordered Quantity is the total item quantity ordered in the initial order (without any changes).
- Price Each - The price of each products.
- Order Date - This is the date the customer is requesting the order be shipped.
- Purchase Address - The purchase order is prepared by the buyer, often through a purchasing department. The purchase order, or PO, usually includes a PO number, which is useful in matching shipments with purchases; a shipping date; billing address; shipping address; and the request items, quantities and price.
